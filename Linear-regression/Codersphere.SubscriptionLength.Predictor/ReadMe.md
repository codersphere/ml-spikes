## Problem statement
I have a fictional subscription service for music videos.

Based on existing data, I would like to predict the length of a subscription given a specific set of demographic information we collect about users on our service.

This information is crucial for the marketing team so that they can understand the most profitable demographics to target for new sales and renewals.

You will need Visual Studio and .NET Core 3 or greater.

## Instructions

You can change the input values in the Program.cs file.
Just launch the console application in Visual Studio to see the model traine and tested followed by a prediction.
